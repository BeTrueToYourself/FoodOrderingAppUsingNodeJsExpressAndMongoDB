# FoodOrderingAppUsingNodeJsExpressAndMongoDB
It is a project of INT222 for my engineering minor. In this project, I will work on technology like NodeJS, Express, And MongoDB. Food Ordering Website will be catering to all kind of modularity as per customer need and also will be a real time project for my ends.
In this project, I have made registration and login page with the integration with MongoDB. I have used NodeJs, Express, And Handlebars for designing and validating/authenticating the complete UI. I have used the modularity for adding food items to cart and then ordering the favourite food items by paying and reflecting in their profile about the order they have made.

Unique feature of the Project :
I have used stripe key for payment gateway in addition to proper validation/authentication of transaction being done.
